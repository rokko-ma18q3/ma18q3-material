 # Balanced Growth

## Long-run equilibrium

Since `\(k(t)\)` alwyas converges to steady state `\(k^*\)`, `\(k^*\)` can be considered as 
the long-run equilibrium.

The economy with 

`$$k(t) = k^*$$`

is a nice benchmark case for our study.

In the steady state, there is no growth in `\(k\)`. 

But what about `\(Y, K, C\)` and `\(Y/L, K/L, C/L\)`?


---

## Aggregate variables

In the steady state,

`$$K = AL k^*,\quad
Y = ALf(k^*), \quad \text{and} \quad
C = AL (1 - s)f(k^*)$$`

They all grow at the rate of 

`$$g + n$$`


---

## Per-capita variables

In the steady state,

`$$\frac{K}{L} = Ak^*, \quad
\frac{Y}{L} = Af(k^*), \quad \text{and}, \quad
\frac{C}{L} = A(1-s)f(k^*)$$`

They all grow at the rate of 

`$$g$$`


---

## Balanced Growth

In the steady state, all the important variables grow at constant rates.

This situation is called **balanced growth**.

We use phrases "in the steady state" and "along the balanced growth path"
interchangeably.

---

## Interest rate

The firm's profit maximization in the competitive factor market
dictates that marginal product of capital equals rate of return
on capital.

`$$\frac{\partial F}{\partial K} = r + \delta$$`

Notice that 

`$$\frac{\partial}{\partial K}F(K, AL)
= AL \frac{\partial}{\partial K}F(k(K, AL), 1)
= AL \frac{d F(k, 1)}{dk} \frac{\partial k}{\partial K}$$`


`$$\Longrightarrow
\frac{\partial F}{\partial K} = f'(k)$$`

since `\(dk/dK = 1/AL\)`.

---

## Interest rate (cont'd)

In the steady state, 

`$$f'(k^*) = r + \delta,$$`
which is constant over time.

---

## Wage


The firm's profit maximization in the competitive factor market
dictates that marginal product of labor equals wage rate.

`$$\frac{\partial F}{\partial L} = w$$`

By Euler's theorem on homogeneous functions,

`$$F(K, AL) = K \frac{\partial F}{\partial K} + L \frac{\partial F}{\partial L}$$`

---

## Wage (cont'd)

Divide by `\(AL\)` to get

`$$f(k) = k f'(k) + \frac{w}{A}$$`

and 

`$$w = A\left[f(k) - kf'(k)\right]$$`

It is sometimes useful to introduce thewage per unit of effective labor 

`$$\hat{w} := \frac{w}{A} = f(k) - kf'(k)$$`

---

## Exercise: Stylized facts

Verify that the steady state of the Solow model can explain the stylized facts.

1. `\(Y / L\)` grows at a sustained rate.
2. `\(K / L\)` grows at a sustained rate.
3. `\(r\)` is constant.
4. `\(K / Y\)` is constant.
5. `\((r + \delta)K / Y\)` and `\(wL / Y\)` are constant.


---


## Quiz

Consider a Solow economy. 
How fast does the wage grow along the balanced growth path? 

--

Recall

`$$w = A\left[f(k^*) - k^*f'(k^*)\right]$$`

## Welfare gain in the long run

Whether or not the consumption becomes larger than the original steady-state 
value in the long run depends on the initial saving rate.

The steady-state value for consumption per unit of effective labor 

`$$c^* = \frac{C}{AL}$$`

is maximized when

`$$f'(k^*) = \delta + g + n$$`

---

## Welfare gain in the long run

Let `\(s_G\)` be the saving rate that the corresponding steady state `\(k^*_G\)`
satisfies

`$$f'(k^*_G) = \delta + g + n$$`

* `\(s_G\)` and `\(k^*_G\)` and the Golden-Rule
* If an economy in the steady state with `\(s_1 &lt; s_G\)` experiences a hike 
  in the saving rate to `\(s_2 &lt; s_G\)`, then the consumption per unit of effective 
  labor initially drops but eventually gets larger than the original steady 
  state value
  
---

## Dynamic inefficiency for `\(s &gt; s_G\)`

Let's do a similar exercise with `\(s &gt; s_G\)`.
  
Suppose that the economy's saving rate is `\(s_1 &gt; s_G\)` and it's on the 
balanced growth path. The saving rate suddenly drops to `\(s_2 &gt; s_G\)`. 


The economy increases the amount of consumption immediately and continue 
to enjoy larger consumption. 

This means that if the consumers are allowed to chose their saving rate,
they wouldn't choose `\(s &gt; s_G\)` because by reducing `\(s\)` they can consume more
at any point in time.


---

## Exercise

What happens in response to the following changes of parameter?

* Increase/decrease of `\(\delta\)`
* Increase/decrease of `\(g\)`
* Increase/decrease of `\(n\)`

Describe 

* long-run growth and 
* transition path to the new steady state

 # some empirical observations

## Cobb-Douglas production function

Let's suppose
`$$\begin{aligned}
  F(K, AL) = K^\alpha (AL)^{1-\alpha}, \quad 0 &lt; \alpha &lt;1
\end{aligned}$$`

Corresponding intensive form:

--

`$$\begin{aligned}
  f(k) = k^\alpha
\end{aligned}$$`

--

The steady state for the Solow model

--

`$$\begin{aligned}
  k^* = \left(
    \frac{s}{\delta + g + n}
  \right)^{\frac{1}{1 - \alpha}}
\end{aligned}$$`


---

## What's `\(\alpha\)`?

`\(\alpha\)` is the capital share!

Exercise: Prove that 

`$$\begin{aligned}
  \alpha = \frac{(r + \delta) K}{Y}
\end{aligned}$$`

 # Convergence

## Growth rate in transition

Consider a transition path.

The growth rate of output

`$$\begin{aligned}
\frac{\frac{d}{dt}\left( Y/L \right)}{Y/L} &amp;=
\frac{\frac{d}{dt}\left( Ak^\alpha \right)}{Ak^\alpha} =
g + \alpha \frac{\dot k}{k}
\end{aligned}$$`

Since the second term is large and positive when `\(k\)` is small, 
relatively poor countries tend to grow rapidly. 


---

## Testable prediction

If the Solow model is correct, the growth rate declines as an economy matures. This trend should be widely observed and we call this situation "convergence."

You can estimate the following model to test if the average growth rate is negatively correlated with the initial wealth. 


`$$\begin{aligned}
   \ln \left(Y_t/L_t \right) - \ln \left( Y_0/L_0 \right)
   =
   \beta_0 + \beta_1 \ln(Y_0 / L_0)
\end{aligned}$$`

 # Cross-country income differences

## Per-capita income

Per-capita income in the steady state is

`$$\begin{aligned}
  \frac{Y}{L} 
  &amp;= 
  A \left(
    \frac{s}{\delta + g + n}
  \right)^{\frac{\alpha}{1 - \alpha}}\\
  &amp;=
  A(0)e^{gt}
  \left(
    \frac{s}{\delta + g + n}
  \right)^{\frac{\alpha}{1 - \alpha}}
\end{aligned}$$`

Taking log,

`$$\begin{aligned}
  \ln \frac{Y}{L} = \text{const.} + gt 
    +\frac{\alpha}{1 - \alpha} \ln s
    -\frac{\alpha}{1 - \alpha} \ln (\delta + g + n)
\end{aligned}$$`


---

## Testable prediction

`$$\begin{aligned}
  \ln \frac{Y}{L} = \text{const.} + gt 
    +\frac{\alpha}{1 - \alpha} \ln s
    -\frac{\alpha}{1 - \alpha} \ln (\delta + g + n)
\end{aligned}$$`

The Solow model predicts that, other things being equal, one percent increase in `\(s\)` (e.g. from 30% to 30.3%) results in an increase of `\(Y/L\)` by `\(\frac{\alpha}{1 - \alpha}\times 100\)` percent.

Common wisdom suggests `\(\alpha \simeq 1/3\)` and the elasticity of output with respect to the saving rate should thus be

`$$\frac{\alpha}{1-\alpha} \simeq \frac{1}{2}$$`
