## Review for the problem set


- `\(Y/L\)` grows at a sustained rate (Item 1)
- `\(K/Y\)` is constant (Item 4)

jointly imply

- `\(K/L\)` grows at a sustained rate. (Item 2)

---

## Proof

Notice that 

`$$\begin{aligned}
  \frac{K}{L} = \underbrace{\frac{K}{Y}}_{\text{is constant}} 
                \times
                \underbrace{\frac{Y}{L}}_{\text{has a constant growth rate}}
\end{aligned}$$`

We have `\(K/L\)` has a constant growth rate. 

`\(K/L\)` and `\(Y/L\)` grow at the same rate.

---

## Growth rate 

Let `\(X\)` be a time-series variable and `\(g_X\)` the growth rate of `\(X\)`, i.e.,

`$$g_X = \frac{\dot X}{X}$$`

Interpret this with the "discrete-time approximation." 

`$$\begin{aligned}
  \frac{\dot X(t)}{X(t)} 
  \simeq
  \frac{[X(t+\Delta t) - X(t)] / \Delta t}{ X(t)}
\end{aligned}$$`


---

## Growth rate 


It might be tempting to define the growth rate with 

`$$\begin{aligned}
  &amp; \frac{X(t+\Delta t) - X(t)}{X(t)}  &amp; (\text{bad formula!})
\end{aligned}$$`

but this is wrong. You always get zero when `\(\Delta t \to 0\)`.

Convert the change in `\(X\)` into an equivalent change for a year (or month/quarter etc.) and then compute the growth rate. 

This is why we have `\(\Delta t\)` in 

`$$\begin{aligned}
  \frac{\dot X(t)}{X(t)} 
  \simeq
  \frac{[X(t+\Delta t) - X(t)] / \Delta t}{ X(t)}
  =
  \frac{\text{Change in one year}}{\text{Original level}}
\end{aligned}$$`


---

## Growth rate formulas

Let `\(X, Y\)` be a time-series variable and `\(\alpha\)` a constant number.

We have the following formulas: 

1. ** `\(g_{XY} = g_X + g_Y\)`**. Equivalently, 
`$$\frac{\frac{d}{dt}(XY)}{XY} = \frac{\dot X}{X} + \frac{\dot Y}{Y}$$`
1. ** `\(g_{X/Y} = g_X - g_Y\)`**
1. ** `\(g_{X^\alpha} = \alpha g_X\)`**

---

[Your turn] Prove these facts using:

`$$\begin{aligned}
  \frac{d}{dt}\left(
    \ln X
  \right)
  =
  \frac{\dot X}{X}
\end{aligned}$$`

 # Solow Model 



---

## Solow Model

The following parameters characterize the Solow model:

- `\(F(K, AL)\)`: production function
- `\(s\)`: saving rate
- `\(\delta\)`: depreciation rate
- `\(g\)`: technology growth rate
- `\(n\)`: population growth rate

---

---

## Assumptions on the production function

In the Solow model, 

- The technical change is purely labor augmenting, i.e.
  `$$\tilde{F}(K, L, A) = F(K, AL)$$`
- The production function, `\(F\)`, is homogeneous of degree one, i.e., for 
  all `\(c \ge 0\)`,
  `$$F(cK, cAL) = cF(K, AL)$$`

`\(AL\)` is called **effective labor**.

---

## Assumption on the consumer behavior

A constant fraction, `\(s\)`, of output is saved, and the rest, `\(1 - s\)`, is consumed; i.e.,

`$$C = (1 - s) Y \quad \text{and}\quad S = sY$$`

Under the closed economy assumption, `\(S = I\)`. 

The saving rate, `\(s\)`, is constant. The capital accumulation equation can be written as:

`$$\begin{aligned}
  \dot K
  &amp;= I - \delta K\\
  &amp;= S - \delta K\\
  &amp;= sY - \delta K\\
  &amp;= sF(K, AL) - \delta K
\end{aligned}$$`

---

## Assumption on growth of `\(A\)` and `\(L\)`

Knowledge `\(A\)` and labor (or population) `\(L\)` grow at exogenously
given constant rates.

`$$\begin{aligned}
  \dot A &amp;= g A\\
  \dot L &amp;= n L
\end{aligned}$$`

- `\(g\)` is the growth rate of technology and 
- `\(n\)` the population growth rate.

We assume that 

`$$\delta + g + n &gt; 0$$`

---

## Capital per unit of effective labor

Variables of interest are 

* `\(Y\)`: Output
* `\(K\)`: Capital
* `\(C\)`: Consumption
* `\(Y/L\)`: Output per capita
* `\(K/L\)`: Capital per capita
* `\(C/L\)`: Consumption per capita

Instead of analyzing the behavior of them directly, we study that of
**capital per effective labor**

`$$k = \frac{K}{AL}$$`

---

## Output per unit of effective labor

`$$\begin{aligned}
  \frac{Y}{AL} 
  = \frac{F(K, AL)}{AL}
  = F\left(
    \frac{K}{AL}, \frac{AL}{AL}
  \right)
  = F(k, 1)
\end{aligned}$$`

Define
`$$y = \frac{Y}{AL} \quad
\text{and} \quad
f(k) = F(k, 1).$$`

We have the **intensive-form production function**
`$$y = f(k)$$`


---

## Assumption on `\(f\)`

The following assumptions are made for `\(f\)`:

* `\(f(0) = 0\)`
* `\(f'(k) &gt; 0\)`
* `\(f''(k) &lt; 0\)` 
* `\(f'(0) &gt; (\delta + g + n) / s\)`
* `\(f'(\infty) &lt; (\delta + g + n) / s\)`

Usually we assume stronger conditions called Inada conditions:

* `\(f'(0) = \infty\)`
* `\(f'(\infty) = 0\)`

---

## Shape of `\(f\)`

`\(f\)` is increasing, has diminishing marginal productivity, and satisfies Inada conditions.

## Capital accumulation per `\(AL\)`

Divide by `\(AL\)`

`$$\dot K = sF(K, AL) - \delta K$$`

to get 

--

`$$\frac{\dot K}{AL} = sf(k) - \delta k$$`
and then 

`$$\frac{\dot K}{K} k = sf(k) - \delta k$$`


How can we express `\(\dot K/K\)` with `\(k\)`?

---

## `\(\dot K / K =\ ?\)`

Recall that 

`$$k = \frac{K}{AL}$$`

The growth rate of `\(k\)` is 

`$$\begin{aligned}
\frac{\dot k}{k}
&amp;= \frac{\dot K}{K} - \frac{\dot A}{A} - \frac{\dot L}{L}\\
\end{aligned}$$`

and thus

`$$\begin{aligned}
  \frac{\dot K}{K}
  =
  \frac{\dot k}{k} + g + n
\end{aligned}$$`


---

## Capital accumulation equation 

We now have 
`$$\begin{aligned}
  \frac{\dot K}{K} k &amp;= sf(k) - \delta k\\
  \frac{\dot K}{K}   &amp;= \frac{\dot k}{k} + g + n
\end{aligned}$$`

Therefore,

`$$\dot k = sf(k) - (\delta + g + n) k$$`

This is _the_ fundamental differential equation that governs the dynamics 
of the Solow economy.


---

## Dynamics

`$$\dot k = sf(k) - (\delta + g + n) k$$`

* `\(sf(k) &gt; (\delta + g + n) k \Longrightarrow k\)` increases.
* `\(sf(k) = (\delta + g + n) k \Longrightarrow k\)` stays unchanged.
* `\(sf(k) &lt; (\delta + g + n) k \Longrightarrow k\)` decreases.

Due to the assumptions on `\(f\)`, it is shown that 

* `\(k\)` grows when `\(k\)` is sufficiently small
* `\(k\)` decreases when `\(k\)` is sufficiently large

There is a threashold value `\(k^*\)`, below which `\(k\)` grows and above which `\(k\)` decreases.

 # Balanced Growth 



---

## Long-run equilibrium

Since `\(k(t)\)` alwyas converges to steady state `\(k^*\)`, `\(k^*\)` can be considered as 
the long-run equilibrium.

The economy with 

`$$k(t) = k^*$$`

is a nice benchmark case for our study.

In the steady state, there is no growth in `\(k\)`. 

But what about `\(Y, K, C\)` and `\(Y/L, K/L, C/L\)`?


---

## Aggregate variables

In the steady state,

`$$K = AL k^*,\quad
Y = ALf(k^*), \quad \text{and} \quad
C = AL (1 - s)f(k^*)$$`

They all grow at the rate of 

`$$g + n$$`


---

## Per-capita variables

In the steady state,

`$$\frac{K}{L} = Ak^*, \quad
\frac{Y}{L} = Af(k^*), \quad \text{and}, \quad
\frac{C}{L} = A(1-s)f(k^*)$$`

They all grow at the rate of 

`$$g$$`


---

## Balanced Growth

In the steady state, all the important variables grow at constant rates.

This situation is called **balanced growth**.

We use phrases "in the steady state" and "along the balanced growth path"
interchangeably.

---

## Interest rate

The firm's profit maximization in the competitive factor market
dictates that marginal product of capital equals rate of return
on capital.

`$$\frac{\partial F}{\partial K} = r + \delta$$`

Notice that 

`$$\frac{\partial}{\partial K}F(K, AL)
= AL \frac{\partial}{\partial K}F(k(K, AL), 1)
= AL \frac{d F(k, 1)}{dk} \frac{\partial k}{\partial K}$$`


`$$\Longrightarrow
\frac{\partial F}{\partial K} = f'(k)$$`

since `\(dk/dK = 1/AL\)`.

---

## Interest rate (cont'd)

In the steady state, 

`$$f'(k^*) = r + \delta,$$`
which is constant over time.

---

## Wage


The firm's profit maximization in the competitive factor market
dictates that marginal product of labor equals wage rate.

`$$\frac{\partial F}{\partial L} = w$$`

By Euler's theorem on homogeneous functions,

`$$F(K, AL) = K \frac{\partial F}{\partial K} + L \frac{\partial F}{\partial L}$$`

---

## Wage (cont'd)

Divide by `\(AL\)` to get

`$$f(k) = k f'(k) + \frac{w}{A}$$`

and 

`$$w = A\left[f(k) - kf'(k)\right]$$`

It is sometimes useful to introduce thewage per unit of effective labor 

`$$\hat{w} := \frac{w}{A} = f(k) - kf'(k)$$`

---

## Exercise: Stylized facts

Verify that the steady state of the Solow model can explain the stylized facts.

1. `\(Y / L\)` grows at a sustained rate.
2. `\(K / L\)` grows at a sustained rate.
3. `\(r\)` is constant.
4. `\(K / Y\)` is constant.
5. `\((r + \delta)K / Y\)` and `\(wL / Y\)` are constant.



---

## Quiz

How fast does the wage grow along the balanced growth path? 

--

Recall

`$$w = A\left[f(k^*) - k^*f'(k^*)\right]$$`
